# Veil
## Description:
Project for creating steganographic files.

## Future work:
* Support more complicated file formats like PNG or JPEG. 
* Add customization options to file formats already supported. Example: user picks the sample rate of a wav or au file, or the dimensions of a BMP
* Encode and decode unicode characters, as opposed to just printable ASCII. 
* Automatically generate a pseudo-random keystream to encode the steganographic file, as opposed to the user picking a key.
